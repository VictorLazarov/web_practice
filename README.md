# WEB Course Practice Repository

This repository is dedicated to the practice part of my university course on "WEB". It contains various exercises and projects that are part of the curriculum.

## Requirements

To run the projects in this repository, you must use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.

## Setup

1. Download and install XAMPP from the [official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
2. Clone this repository into the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation.
3. Start the Apache and MySQL services from the XAMPP control panel.
4. Access the projects via `http://localhost/[your-project-folder]`.

## Usage

Follow the instructions provided in each project folder to understand how to run and interact with the specific exercises.

Happy coding!
